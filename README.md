##  üîß Installation
To start the project we need to install the following libraries and do these steps.

### MongoDB
An updated version of MongoDB is included in the official Ubuntu package repositories. This means that we can install the necessary packages using apt.
* Install
```
sudo apt install -y mongodb
```
* Check MongoDB
```
sudo systemctl status mongodb
```

### NodeJS
Ubuntu 20.04 contains a version of Node.js in its default repositories that can be used to provide a consistent experience across multiple systems. At the time this article was written, the version in the repositories is 10.19. This will not be the latest version, but it should be stable and sufficient for quick experimentation with the language.
* Install
```
sudo apt install nodejs
```
```
sudo apt install npm
```
* Check
```
node -v
```

### Dependencies
Both in the backend and in the frontend we have to install the necessary dependencies for the web.
```
sudo npm install
```

## üöÄ  Getting started

#### Database

```
sudo service mongod start
```

#### Backend
```
cd backend
```

* ##### Rest
```
sudo npm run dev
```

* ##### Graphql
```
sudo npm run dev
```

#### Frontend

```
sudo gulp
```

The default browser will automatically open and run the application.
